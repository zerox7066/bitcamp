@ Join     https://zetawiki.com/wiki/MySQL_합집합,_교집합,_차집합,_대칭차

 - A 만 Left Join (Left Outer Join)
 
   select a.column, b.column
   from TableA A
   left join TableB b
   on a.key = b.key


 - 차집합
 
   select a.column, b.column
   from TableA A
   left join TableB b
   on a.key = b.key
   where b.key is null


   SELECT str FROM tableA WHERE str NOT IN (
	SELECT DISTINCT str FROM tableB ); 




 - 교집합 

   SELECT <select_list> 
   FROM TableA A
   INNER JOIN TableA B
   ON A.Key = B.Key 


   SELECT a.str FROM tableA a, tableB b WHERE a.str = b.str;




 - 합집합 : MySql에서는 Full Outer Join이 없음

  SELECT str FROM tableA
  UNION
  SELECT str FROM tableB;



 - 대칭차집합

   SELECT str FROM (
	SELECT str FROM tableA
	UNION ALL
	SELECT str FROM tableB
   ) AS tmp
   GROUP BY str HAVING COUNT(*)=1



  SELECT str FROM tableA WHERE str NOT IN ( SELECT DISTINCT str FROM tableB )
  UNION ALL
  SELECT str FROM tableB WHERE str NOT IN ( SELECT DISTINCT str FROM tableA )
